                  Description:="Sometimes when you are designing a form, or creating some other kind of visual output, you'd like to generate an array of colors which may be shades of a single color or a discernible sequence of individual colors such as the spectrum of a rainbow.  This can be useful for coloring bars in a graph or generating a gradient around some specified color.  Unfortunately the .Net framework does not give us any sophisticated solution for this.
                  <br />
While any number of complex code solutions could be created to attempt to address this problem, if we think of the RGB color space spatially, we can construct a three-dimensional cube which represents all possible colors and can easily be traversed mathematically.",
