> **Figure 2** Metavirome network. A visualization of the all-verses-all BLAST network. Viral groups are assigned a unique color and were visualized in Gephi. Separation of the viral groups was accomplished using Gephiâ€™s Force Atlas 2 plugin, a force-directed layout algorithm. Ovals highlight viral groups whose members matched against seeded viruses in a parallel network analysis. Despite the large number of seeded viruses (1812), only 26 viruses were assigned to viral groups. All 26 viruses were crenarchaeal viruses. Edge connections are lines connecting members within a viral group and between members of differing viral groups. Care should be taken to not associate distance between viral groups as indicative of sequence similarity. To enhance clarity and distinctions between viral groups, only those containing 50 contigs or more are included in the figure. Viral groups numbering: group 0 = SIRV-1,2; group 23 = ASV-1, SSV-1-2, 4-9; group 26 = ATV; group 28 = AFV-1; group 29 = STIV-1,2; group 31 = AFV2-3, 6-9, SIFV; group 32 = STST-1,2 and ARSV-1, SRV.
