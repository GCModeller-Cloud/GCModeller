    ''' ## ARDB - Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database
    ''' 
    ''' https://ardb.cbcb.umd.edu/
    ''' 
    ''' The general idea during the construction of ARDB is to build a database centered on
    ''' antibiotic resistance genes. Antibiotic resistance genes are organized into resistance
    ''' types, And genes belonging to a same resistance type have high sequence similarity And
    ''' have same functional mechanisms. Some resistance types will be further organized into
    ''' resistance Class, And genes belonging to a same resistance class have same functional
    ''' mechanisms but may Not have high sequence similarity. Each resistance gene Is
    ''' annotated with rich information by mapping resistance types to relevant information in
    ''' other databases, such As CDD, COG, GO. Each antibiotic Is also associated With rich
    ''' information from other databases, such As PubChem Compound Database, ChEBI And MeSH.
