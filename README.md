Feature tools:
1. NCBI localblast utility
2. MEME tools combine with Regprecise database
3. Circos plots utility
4. Protein structure analysis tools
5. KEGG database tools
6. Reactome/MetaCyc database tools
7. Venn diagram drawing tools
8. Cytoscape utility tools
9. Motif Parallel alignment tools for the protein interaction network and family annotation

The main virtual cell analysis engine is under development progress.
